mother. In the sixth year of her foundation, in the first month,
on the fifth day of the month—-that is, the nones of J anuary—

a convent¹ is sent out from the house of Fountains to New·

Minster, with the abbot Robert‚ a holy and religious man,
formerly a monk of Whitby, who allied himself with them when
they went out from the York house.2 Of this man we have heard
many things worthy of being related, to which a special treatise
shall be devoted.³ For he was modest in bearing, gentle in
social life, merciful in judgment, singular in holy conversation.
For many years he both presided over and was profitable to the
brethren as a holy father and excellent pastor, and he com-

holy man, released from the flesh, carried into heaven by the
hands of angels. Such was the beginning of New Minster.
This was the first branc-h which our vine put forth, this the
first swarm which came out from our hive. The holy seed took
root in the soil, as if cast into the bosom of the fertile earth ;

it grew into a heap, and from a few grains arose a plenteous

her mother. She conceived and bare three daughters of her

own, founding Pipewell‚ Sawley, and Roche.'⁴ We learn from

John of Hexham⁵ that eight monks came from Fountains‚ and

were at first housed by Ranulph de Merlay in his castle of

and this was the number usually sent to new places by the statutos of the
order3 but in this case there seem to have been only eight. See beloW.

² The mother house of Fountains originally consisted of Benedictine
monks of St. Mary’s Abbey in York, who seceded from that house on
account of the laxity and lukewarmness which prevailed there. After their
separation they adopted the Cistercjan habit and chose St. Bernard as their
